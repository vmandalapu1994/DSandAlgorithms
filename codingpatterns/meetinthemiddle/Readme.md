Q) What is meet in the middle algorithm used to solve subset sum difference problem? Please explain in detail.

Of course. Let's dive deep into the **Meet-in-the-Middle** algorithm and see how it provides an elegant solution to this
specific problem.

### The Core Idea: An Analogy

Imagine two people, Alex and Ben, want to meet on a very long, straight road that is 30 kilometers long.

* **The Brute-Force way:** Alex starts at kilometer 0 and walks all 30 kilometers, checking every single meter to see if
  Ben is there. This is slow and exhaustive.
* **The Meet-in-the-Middle way:** Alex starts at kilometer 0 and Ben starts at kilometer 30. They both agree to walk
  towards the center (kilometer 15). Alex only has to walk 15 km, and Ben only has to walk 15 km. They will inevitably
  meet somewhere in the middle. The total effort is drastically reduced.

The Meet-in-the-Middle algorithm applies this same principle to computational problems. Instead of searching a massive
space of possibilities, we split the problem in half, generate all possibilities for each half independently, and then
find an optimal way to combine the results.

### The Problem with Brute Force Here

First, let's understand why a simple approach fails. The problem asks us to pick `n` elements for one subset out of a
total of `2n` elements. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient "2n choose n", or $C(2n, n)$.

For the maximum constraint `n = 15`, we have `2n = 30`. The number of combinations is:
$$C(30, 15) = \frac{30!}{15! \cdot 15!} = 155,117,520$$
Checking over 155 million partitions is far too slow and will time out. This brute-force complexity is roughly $O(4^n)$,
which is too high.

### Applying Meet-in-the-Middle

The constraint `n <= 15` is the key. An algorithm with a complexity around $O(2^n)$ would be acceptable,
since $2^{15} = 32,768$, a very manageable number. Meet-in-the-Middle gets us there.

Here is the detailed, step-by-step application of the algorithm to this problem.

#### Step 1: Divide

The first step is to split the problem space. We take the input array `nums` of size `2n` and divide it into two halves,
each of size `n`.

* `left_half`: Contains elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[n-1]`.
* `right_half`: Contains elements from `nums[n]` to `nums[2n-1]`.

**Example:** `nums = [2, -1, 0, 4, -2, -9]`, `n = 3`.

* `left_half = [2, -1, 0]`
* `right_half = [4, -2, -9]`

#### Step 2: Conquer (Generate All Subset Sums for Each Half)

This is the "Alex and Ben start walking" part. For each half, we will find every possible sum we can make by choosing
any number of elements from it. Crucially, we must also keep track of **how many elements** we chose to get that sum.

We can do this with a recursive function (DFS). For each half, we generate all $2^n$ possible subsets.

The result will be a data structure, let's say a list of lists (or a map), where `left_sums[k]` contains a list of all
possible sums you can get by choosing exactly `k` elements from the `left_half`.

**Continuing the Example (`n=3`):**

* **For `left_half = [2, -1, 0]`:**
    * `left_sums[0]`: {0}  *(sum of 0 elements)*
    * `left_sums[1]`: {2, -1, 0}  *(sums of 1 element)*
    * `left_sums[2]`: {1, 2, -1}  *(sums of 2 elements: 2-1, 2+0, -1+0)*
    * `left_sums[3]`: {1}  *(sum of all 3 elements: 2-1+0)*

* **For `right_half = [4, -2, -9]`:**
    * `right_sums[0]`: {0}
    * `right_sums[1]`: {4, -2, -9}
    * `right_sums[2]`: {2, -5, -11}
    * `right_sums[3]`: {-7}

This step has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$ for each half.

#### Step 3: Combine (The "Meet")

Now that we have all possible partial sums from both halves, we need to combine them to form a complete partition of
size `n`.

Let the sum of all elements in the original `nums` array be `TotalSum`. Our goal is to find a partition sum, `S`, that
is as close as possible to `TotalSum / 2`. This minimizes the final difference `|TotalSum - 2*S|`.

If we pick `k` elements from the `left_half` with a sum of `s1`, we **must** pick `n - k` elements from the `right_half`
with a sum of `s2`.

The core logic is to iterate through the left half's sums and, for each one, find the best possible partner from the
right half's sums.

1. **Sort the Right Sums:** For each size `k` from 0 to `n`, sort the list `right_sums[k]`. This is the most critical
   optimization, enabling the next step.

2. **Iterate and Search:**
    * Loop `k` from `0` to `n`. `k` is the number of elements we take from the left.
    * For each `s1` in the list `left_sums[k]`:
        * We need to find a sum `s2` from the list `right_sums[n-k]`.
        * Our target combined sum is `TotalSum / 2`. So, the ideal `s2` would be: `target_s2 = (TotalSum / 2) - s1`.
        * Since `right_sums[n-k]` is sorted, we can use **binary search** to find the value in that list that is closest
          to `target_s2`. This is incredibly fast ($O(\log N)$).
        * The binary search will give us an insertion point. The two values at that point and just before it are the
          best candidates for the closest sum. We check both to see which one gives a smaller overall difference.
        * For each combination (`s1 + s2`), we calculate the partition sum `S = s1 + s2` and update our global minimum
          difference: `min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(TotalSum - 2 * S))`.

By iterating through one set of results (`left_sums`) and using binary search on the other (`right_sums`), we
efficiently find the "meeting point" without having to test all `C(2n, n)` combinations.

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot 2^n)$
    * Generating sums for each half: $O(2^n)$.
    * Sorting the right sums: The total number of sums is $2^n$. Sorting them takes
      roughly $O(2^n \cdot \log(2^n)) = O(n \cdot 2^n)$.
    * The final search loop: We iterate through $2^n$ sums on the left and do a binary search ($O(\log(2^n)) = O(n)$)
      for each. This gives $O(n \cdot 2^n)$.
    * The dominant factor is $O(n \cdot 2^n)$, which is vastly better than the brute-force $O(C(2n, n)) \approx O(4^n)$.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(2^n)$
    * We need to store all the generated sums from both halves. The total number of subset sums
      is $\sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k) = 2^n$.

In summary, the Meet-in-the-Middle algorithm transforms an unsolvable exponential problem into a solvable one by
splitting the search space, pre-calculating all possibilities for each half, and then intelligently combining the
results using a fast search technique like binary search.
