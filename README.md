## 🔍 Polynomial Rolling Hash

A **Polynomial Rolling Hash** is a hashing technique used to efficiently compute hash values of substrings in a way that:
- Is fast
- Avoids collisions (to a good extent)
- Allows rolling: i.e., compute the hash of `s[i+1..j+1]` from `s[i..j]` in constant time

---

## 💡 Hash Formula

For a string `s = s[0..k-1]` of length `k`, we treat it like a base-`p` number:

```
Hash(s) = s[0] * p^{k-1} + s[1] * p^{k-2} + ... + s[k-1] * p^0 mod M
```
- `p`: a small prime number (e.g. 31 or 101)
- `M`: a large prime number (to avoid overflow)
- `s[i]`: numeric value of the i-th character (e.g., 'A' → 1, 'C' → 2, etc.)

This behaves like how numbers work in positional notation (e.g. base-10: 342 = 3×100 + 4×10 + 2×1).

## ✅ Example

Let's hash "ACGT" with:
- A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4
- Base `p = 101`
- No mod for now (to keep it simple)

```
Hash("ACGT") = 1×101^3 + 2×101^2 + 3×101^1 + 4×101^0
             = 1×1030301 + 2×10201 + 3×101 + 4
             = 1030301 + 20402 + 303 + 4 = 1055010
```

## 🔁 Rolling Hash Mechanism

Suppose you've already computed the hash of "ACGT" → `hash1`.
Now you want the hash of "CGTA" (slide window by 1 character).

Step-by-step:
1. Remove the contribution of the first character ('A').
2. Multiply the remaining hash by `p` (shift positions).
3. Add the new character's contribution ('A' at end).

Formula:

```
NewHash = ((OldHash - s[i] * p^{k-1}) * p + s[i+k]) mod M
```

This lets you slide the window in O(1) time.

## 💎 Benefits

| Feature                | Why it matters                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Rolling (sliding window) | Avoids recomputing hash from scratch |
| Fast substring comparison | O(1) for comparing large substrings  |
| Low collision rate        | Especially with large M, prime p     |
| Space efficient          | Only track current hash + powers of p|

---

## 🔐 Why Modulo?
- To keep numbers within integer limits.
- To ensure unique-ish mapping: two different substrings rarely collide when mod is a large prime (e.g. 1_000_000_007).

## 🔧 Summary of Parameters

| Parameter | Value (Common) | Purpose                        |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| p         | 31, 101       | Prime base for polynomial      |
| M         | 1e9 + 7       | Modulus to reduce collision/overflow |
| s[i]      | 1–26, or 1–4  | Integer mapping of characters  |

---

## 🔁 Summary in Your Context (DNA Strings)
- DNA has 4 characters, so map as: A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4
- For a 10-letter substring, compute its polynomial hash
- Slide the window using rolling hash
- Store hashes in a set to find repeats
